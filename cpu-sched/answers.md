**Question 1**

SJF: The average turnaround time is (200+400+600)/3 = 400. The averge response time is (0+200+400)/3 = 200.

FIFO: Same to SJF.

**Question 2**

SJF: The average turnaround time is (100+300+600)/3 = 333.3. The average response time is (0+100+300)/3 = 133.3.

FIFO: It depends on the order of these 3 jobs.

**Question 3**

With RR, the average turnaround time is (598+599+600)/3 = 599. The average response time is (0+1+2)/3 = 1.

**Question 4**

If the workloads are equal for each job, SJF and FIFO have the same turnaround time.

**Question 5**

If each job (except the last one) has the workload of only 1 time slice, SJF have the same response time with RR.

**Question 6**

**Question 7**
Assuming the quantum length is `k`, the worst response time is `k(N-1)/2`.
